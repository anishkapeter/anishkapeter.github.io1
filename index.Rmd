## About Me 
Hello, my name is Anishka Peter. I was born in Ohio and then moved to Texas when I was little. I enjoy playing guitar, singing, and cooking. I also enjoy travelling around the world and I especially like visiting my family in India. I graduated my undergrad with a B.A in mathematics from the University of Oklahoma in December. I now attend Southern Methodist University working on my masters in Data Science.
